# IBM_DS_CAPSTONE

This a project lessons and steps that I went through for my IBM Capstone project. In this project, I was using data from spaceX to do an analysis on the FalconX. In this analysis, I looked at where the launches took place. The successful launch rate at each place. Then after the analysis, I used machine learning to make a predictive model for the next launches for the FalconX.
